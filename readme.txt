= What is the difference between a price list and a pricing table? =
A pricing table is used to compare different levels of a product or service. For example, you are a web developer, and you sell bronze, silver and gold package. At the same time, a price list is more suitable for a salon, spa, restaurant or any business that sells different products and services that are not related to each otherâ€”for example, buying an iPhone 6, iPhone 7 and iPhone 8, etc.

= My color or fonts not working properly on my pricing table =
1. Try temporarily changing your theme in the theme settings under the Appearance tab. Change your theme to the basic stock theme that WordPress comes standard with and see if this fixes the issue. Do not worry; changing your theme wont lose any customizations or changes you've made.
2. Try investigating if your themes core color settings are interfering or overriding the plugin by seeing it the font and color that is appearing is set somewhere in your theme settings.
3. Are you using Visual Composer, Beaver or any other Page Builders? Make sure the short-code [pricelist id="1494263699"] is placed in the Raw HTML, Site Origin Text Editor, or any other widget that does not alter the CSS of your input.
